[InnovaMonitoring Frontend](http:/https://innovamonitoring.net/ "InnovaMonitoring Frontend")

**Introduction:**
This frontend was developed in React JS 18.2.0, Tailwindcss for the styles, Primereact and
ej2.syncfusion components.
Initially, this project has the Innova Monitoring website, within this project we have a folder called
Dashboard where all the classes of the web application are where you can see the reports, users,
properties, cameras and other information that comes from the backend . In addition to this, there
are statistics, a map of the properties and other information.
It is worth clarifying that the website uses a library called i18next that is responsible for the
translations of the page through json files stored in the Traslations folder.
In addition to the contact form, the page has a questionnaire type form that is used to create a
personalized monitoring plan step by step. 

This application features responsive design, multi-language, various forms, animations and more.
